# Ormuco Test

Question A
Your goal for this question is to write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether they 
overlap. As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8).

Solution: I have created function for Overlap, I have also used Matplotlib to visualize the Overlap between these two lines.

Question B
The goal of this question is to write a software library that accepts 2 version string as input and returns whether one is greater 
than, equal, or less than the other. As an example: “1.2” is greater than “1.1”. Please provide all test cases you could think of.

Solution: QB Test contains solution of this question, while running on command line script will ask for First value and second value. 
You may put values in string and it will give whether these two values are greater, equal or lesser than another value. Attached files 
also contains Test results for QB where 5 random numbers are generating and it gives output result.

Question C
Create an api that takes a string as input and returns a list of text insights from the top 5 google results of the query generated 
by those keywords.

Solution: I have created python script to pass keyword and count of results in command line using argument. Attached file also contain 
search results. Use this script as below:
python Ishan_Shrivastava_QC.py -k keywords -c count_of_results
